# afl_betting

This repository records the experiments and exploration of AFL data for the purposes of finding an edge in the market betting on Betfair.

## Motivation

Betfair have provided $1,000 to bet in the market for a number of people including me. This is just a fun weekend endevour, if we can return some money then great! It may be difficult though...

## Contents (notebooks):
* intital_tips: Provides a simple strategy using prediction from other predictive models
* backtest_squiggle: Goes through the process of testing over the 2017 & 2018 seasons for our simple approach, exploring what the distribution of our payoffs will be

## TODO (Might Do List):
[ ] Build a simple model using log reg for the line market
[ ] Build a process for relative score predictions and repeat simulations
[ ] Collect Twitter data for sentiment analysis (as something different)
